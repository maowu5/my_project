                <h2>Autor</h2>
                <p>Eric Barone (also known as ConcernedApe) is the sole creator of Stardew Valley. Born in 1987, Barone is a self-taught game developer from the U.S. He developed Stardew Valley entirely by himself, including programming, art, music, and writing, over the course of five years (2011-2016). Inspired by the Harvest Moon series, Barone wanted to create his ideal farming simulation game, blending farming, fishing, mining, and social elements.
                    Since its release in 2016, Stardew Valley has become a worldwide success, praised for its charming pixel art, deep gameplay, and relaxing atmosphere. Barone continues to support the game with updates and is currently working on a new project called Haunted Chocolatier. His story inspires indie developers globally, proving that passion and dedication</p>
